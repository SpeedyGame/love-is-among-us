	Colonel: Not so enthusiastic, huh? Why'd you even come here if you don't want to do any work? This ain't a cruise ship buddy, you need to pull your weight. Now get over here and shoot the damn asteroids, or I'll send you out there with a Nerp gun instead!

	Colonel: Now, you'd better hit every last asteroid, or I'll make sure you're scrubbing toilets for the rest of your time on this ship!
