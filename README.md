## Overview
Play as a crewmate aboard a ship and get to know your fellow peers on a deeper level by assisting them in their tasks around the ship. You will need to figure out who is the imposter before the end of the week and prevent the imposter from succeeding in destroying the ship (or be an accomplice if you so choose).
